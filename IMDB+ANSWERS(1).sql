/* Now that you have imported the data sets, let’s explore some of the tables. 
 To begin with, it is beneficial to know the shape of the tables and whether any column has null values.
 Further in this segment, you will take a look at 'movies' and 'genre' tables.*/



-- Segment 1:




-- Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?
-- Type your code below:

-- Number of Rows for MOVIE table
select count(*) from movie;

-- Number of Rows for GENRE table
select count(*) from genre;

-- Number of Rows for NAMES table
select count(*) from names;

-- Number of Rows for RATINGS table
select count(*) from ratings;

-- Number of Rows for DIRECTOR_MAPPING table
select count(*) from director_mapping;

-- Number of Rows for ROLE_MAPPING table
select count(*) from role_mapping;








-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:
SELECT sum(CASE when id IS NULL then 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ID_NULL_COUNT,
               sum(CASE when title IS NULL then 1 ELSE 0 END) AS TITLE_NULL_COUNT,
               sum(CASE when year IS NULL then 1 ELSE 0 END) AS YEAR_NULL_COUNT,
               sum(CASE when date_published IS NULL then 1 ELSE 0 END) AS DATE_PUBLISHED_NULL_COUNT,
			   sum(CASE when duration IS NULL then 1 ELSE 0 END) AS DURATION_NULL_COUNT,
               sum(CASE when country IS NULL then 1 ELSE 0 END) AS COUNTRY_NULL_COUNT,
               sum(CASE when worlwide_gross_income IS NULL then 1 ELSE 0 END) AS WORLDWIDE_GROSS_INCOME_NULL_COUNT,

               sum(CASE when production_company IS NULL then 1 ELSE 0 END) AS PRODUCTION_COMPANY_NULL_COUNT
FROM movie;



-- country, worlwide_gross_income, languages and production_company columns have NULL values



-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year. 
-- Q3. Find the total number of movies released each year? How does the trend look month wise? (Output expected)

-- Q4. How many movies were produced in the USA or India in the year 2019??
-- Type your code below:

-- Q5. Find the unique list of the genres present in the data set?
-- Type your code below:

/* So, RSVP Movies plans to make a movie of one of these genres.
Now, wouldn’t you want to know which genre had the highest number of movies produced in the last year?

-- 4285 Drama movies were produced in total and are the highest among all genres.

-- Q8.What is the average duration of movies in each genre? 
-- (Note: The same movie can belong to multiple genres.)
